# RobotEV3
A Java EV3dev project based on mob41 java


### README
This is a repo for a Lego EV3 programming using Java. Lego Ev3 have to use an external firmware, EV3dev from EV3dev.org, you will find there detailed instruction on how to install the firmware into a microSD card to use with your Lego EV3 Brick.

This project is based on another repo, Mob41 java, that you can find on Ev3dev.org, programming language section, pay attention because there are two java languages project for EV3dev. This one works on top of mob41, and uses its project as base, and its constructed over it, correct it, and I have implemented a new class for speaker usage.

#### CURRENTLY
Not working on it but now, so it has to be completed, and refactored, this project is made for a university exam, content will be
uploaded as soon as possible, but changed firmware to lejos due to a bluetooth problem not solved before the exam. 

#### INSTALLATION
